Domain from Domain Driven Design.

# Domain [?]

When we start writing a software, we sometimes try to 

# Think domain - first

Not database - first. Not legacy code - first. Not test - first. Domain first.

Why?

It's simple. The domain is the most important part of an application. If your domain is good, than your code is well - separated, clean and maintainable. And in a worst case, if the code isn't so maintainable, given the fact that it's a separate and decoupled domain, it should be pretty easy to rewrite the whole thing.

Hold on! Why would I like to think about rewriting or refactors if I haven't written a single line of code yet? That's pretty easy. It's because maintainable code is easy to rewrite. Sometimes it happens that requirements changes, or the code just becomes a plate full of spaghetti (by itself, of course!) and someone has to clean it up (usually this cleanup happens when the guy who wrote this piece of mess does not work anymore in the company for a few years, and you haven't even had a chance to meet him and tell him how bad his code is!)
