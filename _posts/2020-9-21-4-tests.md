Not database - first. Not already-existing-code - first. Not test - first. Domain - first.

# What is a domain?

Domain - an area of interest or an area over which a person has control; a particular interest, activity, or type of knowledge [(source)](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/domain). In the context of DDD, domain is a part of application.

A domain is usually a part of application corresponding to a particular business area of a company (sales, HR, Production, IT). It has its own ubiquitous language, and business rules to meet.

A standard domain in code consists of four elements:
* Context
* Domain
* Model
* Ubiquitous language

Let's take a look at each element.

## Context
The setting in which a word or statement appears that determines its meaning. But what it actually means? 

Let's try to work it out by example. Let's say that there is some company X, which has HR and IT department. Every employer is listed in both departments, but in a different context. 

From a HR perspective, employee is a person who's signed an employment contract and recieves some salary. In case of being sick, employee can deliver a sick leave to employer, and he'll recieve decreased salary.

On the other hand, there is an IT department. They don't really care about employee being sick or by its salary. They care about office equipment - laptops, keyboards and monitors. From their perspecive, an employee is a person which can issue a ticket to get a new laptop or to get his old one fixed. 

Depending on the departament which talks about employee, the imagination of a set of an information needed to specify current employee will be different.

## Domain
In a context of DDD, domain is an area of interests. It can represent a particular department or some business process, like handling tickets issued to IT department (it could be only tickets handling, and we could specify another domain for let's say availability of hardware)

## Model
Different domains should have a different model. There is no need to let IT departament take a look at employee's salary (or even it could be forbidden) - also they shouldn't be able to update employee's salary. So if thay can't view nor update salary, why an employee object in an IT domain should even have `salary` field?

## Ubiquitous language
It's an important part to understand the language that the business uses to describe their domain. Both developers and business should use the same terms referring to a domain.

# Breaking the rules

What could go wrong in here? Let us imagine a situation where we're writing an e-commerce site. The most important thing for a business is to be able to start selling articles as soon as possible. So programmers stared by implementing a critical path - they created a shopping cart, checkout and articles browsing feature. But for some reason, they didn't referred to an `Article` the same way as business did - they reffered it as an `Object`. Object had a set if images, price and a description. The whole work took two months to complete.

```CSharp
public class Object
{
    public decimal Price;
    public List<Image> Images;
    public string Description;
    public void UpdatePrice(decimal newPrice){ /*update price and save object to DB*/ }
    public void UpdateImages(List<Image> newImages){ /*update images and save to DB*/ }
    public void UpdateDescription(string newDescription){ /*update description and save to DB*/ }
}
```

After the critical path was done and our shop could start making money, business came to programmers and asked for another feature - they wanted to be able to keep a list of employees and their basic data in the system, as well as their salaries.

Since they wanted it to be ready on yesterday, programmers decided to re-use some code. They thought, that `Object`, currently representing and `Article` in a different domain, would be a perfect fit. It has already a `Price`, which would fit perfectly as a field to keep salary in it. Also, it has a `Description` field, so we can keep basic informations about employer - we could fit in here holidays, sicl leaves and other basic informations. If we wanted to keep a proto of our employer, there's also a field for this. Last thing is a salary - there is already a field `Price`, which is intended to keep money. It also has already implemented some methods to manage this object, maybe the UI to make simple CRUD operations on `Object` is already done, so with a minimal amount of work and time we're ready to store employers in our system.

Also, since this classe's name is `Object`, it fits into context of employee. Maybe this `Price` doesn't fit perfectly into a `Salary`, but who actually would care about such a small things when we've already got the whole implementation in place?

So programmers sat down, and within a week they had an employee management system, already deployed into production. They used the same UI as for `Articles` - it was designed to manage the same objects. They used the same View, just switched the source of data that fed this view. The business was very happy about how fast they've delivered it and everything was perfect. It was perfect unless... someone decided to change something.


# Think domain - first

Why?

It's simple. The domain is the most important part of an application. If your domain is good, than your code is well - separated, clean and maintainable. And in a worst case, if the code isn't so maintainable, given the fact that it's a separate and decoupled domain, it should be pretty easy to rewrite the whole thing.

Hold on! Why would I like to think about rewriting or refactors if I haven't written a single line of code yet? That's pretty easy. It's because maintainable code should be easy to rewrite. Sometimes it happens that requirements changes, or the code just becomes a plate full of spaghetti (by itself, of course!) and someone has to clean it up (usually this cleanup happens when the guy who wrote this piece of mess does not work anymore in the company for a few years, and you haven't even had a chance to meet him and tell him how bad his code is!)
